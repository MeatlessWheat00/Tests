            Berserk is a dark fantasy manga by Kentaro Miura, set in a medieval-inspired world teeming with supernatural horrors, epic battles, and complex characters. The story centers on Guts, a lone mercenary with a tragic past who wields an enormous sword and possesses an indomitable will. Early in his journey, Guts joins a mercenary group called the Band of the Hawk, led by the magnetic Griffith, a man whose ruthless ambition drives him to rise in power at any cost

                As the story unfolds, Guts and Griffith form a complex friendship, but Griffith’s darker ambitions test their bond. A brutal betrayal sets Guts on a relentless path of revenge, with Griffith sacrificing his humanity to realize his dream—an act that sends Guts on a grueling journey of survival against monstrous enemies and nightmarish foes.

                Berserk resonates with me deeply, as it embodies themes of resilience in the face of extreme adversity. Guts’ journey through unimaginable hardship and trauma is harrowing, yet what makes it powerful is how he grows more human, gradually finding purpose and meaning even as his thirst for vengeance begins to fade. The series’ art is breathtaking, capturing intricate details in every character and landscape that make the world feel alive and hauntingly beautiful.

                At the beginning, Guts struggles with his sense of purpose, feeling as though he lives solely to serve Griffith’s ambitions. Seeking his own path, he decides to leave the Band of the Hawk, triggering one of the story’s most devastating events, as Griffith cannot accept Guts’ departure. This resonates with me personally, as I’ve sometimes felt caught in the flow of others’ expectations and dreams, too complacent to pursue my own. But like Guts, I’m on my own journey to discover my true purpose, embracing the challenges along the way.
