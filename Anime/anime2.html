            Attack on Titan is set in a dystopian world where humanity is confined behind enormous walls to protect themselves from terrifying, man-eating giants called Titans. The story follows Eren Yeager, who, after witnessing the destruction of his home and the death of his mother in a Titan attack, vows to eradicate every Titan. Along with his friends Mikasa and Armin, Eren joins the Scout Regiment, determined to reclaim humanity's freedom and fight for survival.

            What begins as a straightforward quest for vengeance and the reclamation of Eren’s home quickly evolves into a deeper, thought-provoking narrative. The series explores the meaning of freedom, the endless cycle of violence, and how power and control can distort perspectives. One of my favourite aspects of Attack on Titan is its masterful use of foreshadowing. Some of the biggest twists in the show don’t come out of nowhere—they’re carefully set up over time, with subtle clues that eventually lead to mind-blowing reveals, flipping the entire story on its head.

            What resonates most with me is the theme of change, especially seen in Eren. He starts as a one-dimensional character fuelled by revenge, but as the story progresses and he uncovers the harsh truths of the world, he transforms into a complex and morally ambiguous figure. His goals become more extreme, reflecting how deeply people can evolve in response to the world around them. In life, change is inevitable—it’s not inherently good or bad, but constant, and that’s something the show captures brilliantly. The world of Attack on Titan isn’t black and white either; the so-called “bad” people aren’t evil by nature, but driven by their own struggles, while the actions of the “good” characters often cause suffering and moral conflict.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in">
            Ultimately, Attack on Titan was one of the first anime that showed me just how deep and intricate storytelling in this medium can be, tackling complex themes in ways that challenge our understanding of morality, freedom, and the human condition.
