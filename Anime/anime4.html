            Dragon Ball Z is a beloved anime and manga series created by Akira Toriyama, centered around the adventures of Goku, a martial artist with incredible strength and a mysterious past. The series picks up where Dragon Ball left off, focusing on Goku's adult life as he works to protect Earth from increasingly formidable threats.        </p>
        <p class="fade-in">
            Throughout the series, Goku continually pushes himself to grow stronger, facing a diverse range of enemies, from powerful warriors to deadly androids. Alongside his family and friends, including his son Gohan, the warrior Vegeta, and his loyal companion Krillin, Goku takes part in epic battles that challenge the limits of his strength and determination. As the series unfolds, Goku and his allies encounter powerful new forms of combat, including the legendary Super Saiyan transformation, and face challenges that test not only their physical strength but also their resolve and teamwork

            This was the first anime I ever watched, back when I was in middle school. Itâ€™s one of the reasons I developed such a passion for training, as the series portrays the significance of physical growth and effort. I have so many fond memories of coming home from school, sitting down with my brother, and getting hyped for the next big fight. When I heard that Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball, passed away this year, I was devastated. While I never knew him personally, I wish I could thank him for the incredible impact he had on my life. Dragon Ball, and especially Dragon Ball Z, will always hold a special place in my heart.
